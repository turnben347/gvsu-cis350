# Introduction

This is a project to fix a problem of mobile apps abandoning support for smart-home devices. Our goal is to create a desktop app that can control a smart-home light far into the future, not reliant on any app that could drop support. We want to be able to turn the light on/off, change the color, set a on/off schedule and change the brightness. 

# Anticipated Technologies

Pycharm
GitHub
Python
Smart Light
Git

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

Using GV network with smart lights - GV's network is very locked down so it may be diffcult to test and develop the project.
