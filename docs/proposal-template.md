# Introduction

This project aims to address the common issue of mobile apps abandoning support for smart-home devices, leaving users with outdated or non-functional controls. Our goal is to develop a reliable desktop application that can control a smart-home light independently of any third-party apps, ensuring long-term functionality. By creating a dedicated app, we aim to give users full control over their smart lights, including essential features like turning the light on and off, changing its color, adjusting brightness, and setting custom on/off schedules. This solution is designed to be future-proof, offering continued support for smart-home lighting without the risk of losing functionality due to app obsolescence or discontinued support from external developers.

# Anticipated Technologies

Pycharm, GitHub, Python, a Smart Light, Git

# Method/Approach

We plan to use the Waterfall method to develop this project. Its linear, structured approach ensures that our project progresses smoothly from planning and implementation, making it easier to manage with a small group. For a straightforward app with defined features like turning the light on/off or adjusting brightness, Waterfall ensures each phase is completed without needing constant revisions, leading to a hopefully more efficient development process for us. 

# Estimated Timeline

(Figure out what your major milestones for this project will be, including how long you anticipate it *may* take to reach that point)

# Anticipated Problems

Using GV network with smart lights - GV's network is very locked down so it may be diffcult to test and develop the project.
